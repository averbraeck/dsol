/**
 * Simple supply chain model using event scheduling.
 * <p>
 * The second example introduced in this section is again taken from Law &amp; Kelton. In this example we introduce a retailer
 * who sells a single product and would like to know how many items he should have in inventory for each of the next <i>n</i>
 * weeks. Both the conceptual model and its specification in DSOL represent a realistic supply chain model.
