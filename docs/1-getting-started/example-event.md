# Example Queueing model using discrete events

## Introduction
An M/M/1 queueing system is a system with one server (that's what the 1 stands for in M/M/1), and parts or clients arriving at the server with an exponentially distributed inter-arrival time (the first M denotes that) and an exponentially distributed service time (the second M denotes that). 
For an M/M/1 system to be stable, the average service time, denoted as &lambda; should be less than the average inter-arrival time, denoted as &mu;. The ratio between &lambda; and &mu; is called &rho;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lambda;/&mu;, and it is also known as the average utilization of the queueing system.
