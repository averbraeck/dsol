/**
 * Helper classes for reflection (e.g. get ALL constructors or ALL fields of a class). This package provides a number of helper
 * methods to make it easier to use reflection. An example is the ClassUtil class that help to retrieve ALL fields,
 * constructors, or methods of a class including private, package, protected and public methods of the class and its entire tree
 * of superclasses. Other examples are helper classes for signatures and serializable Fields, Methods, and Constructors.
