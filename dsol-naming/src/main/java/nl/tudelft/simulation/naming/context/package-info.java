/**
 * A Context is a JNDI-like implementation to provide tree storage for objects based on keys. Storage can be in memory
 * (JVMContext), in files (FileContext) or on other computers (RemoteContext). In DSOL, statistics and animation objects are
 * stored in a context so they can be easily accessed.
