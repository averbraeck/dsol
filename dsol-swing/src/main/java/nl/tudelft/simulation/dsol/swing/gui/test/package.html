<H2>Single-server queueing system.</H2>
<p>
Consider a single-server queueing system for which the interarrival times are independent and identically distributed.
A customer who arrives and finds the server idle enters service immediately. The service time of the server is again an
independent and identically distributed random variable. A customer who enters and finds the server busy joins the end
of a single queue. Upon completing service for a customer, the server chooses a customer from the queue in a first-in first-out
(FIFO) manner. 
</p>
<p>
The MM1 examples illustrated in this package start with a simulator in "empty-and-idle" state. At t=0 we begin with waiting
for the first arrival which will occur after the first arrival time. We simulate the system until a fixed number of customers (n)
have completed their delays in queue. To measure the performance of this system, we will look at estimates of 3 quantities. 
First we will estimate the expected average delay in queue of the n customers completing their service during the simulation. 
This time delay is represented as d(n). <br> From a system based viewpoint we are going to look at the average number of
entities in the queue q(n) and to the average utilization of the server u(n).
